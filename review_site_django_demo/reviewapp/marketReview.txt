I have had this for a couple months. Used it to with aditional battery. Battery backup is average. Worked just great.

Good phone for the money with one MAJOR flaw for me. This phone can't stream to Bluetooth and do WiFi at the same time. WiFi speeds become unusable. Tried to figure out why. Looks like they share the same antennae on the phone. Bummed out as I use Bluetooth headsets daily. (I have had other budget phones that handle the Bluetooth and WiFi issue just fine.) Other than this it's a good phone for the money. Surprised because the build quality other than this is good.

I'm really surprised what a great phone this is for $250.The battery life is the best I have ever seen, barely hitting 40% after a day of frequent use including Bluetooth audio and navigation. The processor is fast, no lag in apps. The fingerprint sensor works great. I really like the EMUI, much better notification system than the standard Android 6. Camera, reception, display - no regrets here either.Also worth mentioning: Unlike my previous Samsung, Motorola and LG phones, you can actually uninstall/remove all bloatware apps that come with the phone.Definitely recommend this thing!
